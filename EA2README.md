# React
This program provides a demonstration of the JavaScript library *React*. This program is primarily based off of the youtube tutorial at the following link [[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo)], with added functionality to prove my own understanding of React concepts.

## How to Run the Program
When beginning a react project, Node.js as well as NPM must be installed on your device. The following link provides steps to install these [[Install Node.js and NPM](https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac)].

From there, in the terminal, input the following commands:
```
cd .../src
```
cd must be used to change to the src folder of the downloaded React folder. This address could vary user to user. 
```
npm run dev
```
This will provide the local host address for the react app, copy and paste the address into desired browser to open the app.

## Purpose of Program
The purpose of this program is to make use of the basic functionalities of React, while also building a useful todo list tool.

## Examples of I/O
The todo list is a simple app, there is a form to create new todo item, an option to check a todo item off, a form within the todo item to edit the todo item, and a button to delete to do items. 
See the following screenshots outlining the process of creating new todos, editing them, checking them off, and deleting them. 
Todo items will be saved to local storage, meaning if the app is closed, the state of the todo app will be saved. 
### Creating todos
Notice that in addition to the two existing todo items, a *go to class* item has been created.
### Editing todos
Notice the *get the mail* item has been changed to *get the groceries*.
### Completing toodos
Notice that the *water the plants* and *go to class* items have been checked off.
### Deleting todos
Notice that the *get the groceries* item has been checked off.
